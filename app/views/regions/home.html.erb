<h1>THIS IS MY DATABASE</h1>

<h2>A way for me to keep track of the places I have been, and when</h2>

<h3>(And also a way to practice web development)</h3>

<br>
<br>

<h3> Regions </h3>
<h4>(these are categorized very subjectively)</h4>

<% @regions.each do |region| %>
  <h2><%= region.name.upcase %></h2>
  <%= link_to region.name, "/#{region.name}" %> <br>
  <img src="<%=region.image_url %>" alt="<%= region.name %>" width = 200
  <p><%= region.begDate %> - <%= region.endDate %></p>
<%end%>


<body>
  <p>In recalling all of the places i've been to, </p>
  <p>memories inevitably spring back, in rich</p>
  <p>detail that I want to more fully describe...</p>
  <br>
  <p>At some point, this database will be accompanied </p>
  <p>by my writing, and be formed into something of a blog</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>But for now, this will have to do.</p>
</body>
